- Internal network, legacy systems, and data retention.

### Goals
- Assess existing assets and controls to identify gaps.
- Evaluate compliance with relevant regulations such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC standards.
- Provide recommendations to improve Botium Toys' overall security posture.

## Current Assets
The following assets are managed by the IT department:
- On-premises equipment for in-office business needs.
- Employee equipment: desktops, laptops, smartphones, remote workstations, headsets, cables, keyboards, mice, docking stations, surveillance cameras, etc.

## Risk Assessment

### Risk Description
- **Risk Score:** 8/10 (High).
- **Key Risks:**
  1. Unrestricted employee access to sensitive customer data (PII/SPII).
  2. Lack of encryption for sensitive data, including credit card information.
  3. No disaster recovery plan or intrusion detection system (IDS) in place.
